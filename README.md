Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
Examples

[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

## User story 
 a user, I want to one number that is in an odd number  
- User test 1/1: It should be 7 if 7
- User test 1/2: It should be 2 if 1,1,2
